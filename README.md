# spaceSim

2D Physics Simulator geared for simulations of planets and outer space.

# v1

Simple 2 body Simulator.

https://theherobrine422.github.io/spaceSim/v1/

### Features:

1. Modifiable framerate and seconds simulated per frame/physics tick
1. Modifiable mass, starting x/y position, starting velocity, gravity, and color.


# v2

Simulator that can simulate as many bodies as you want. Many added features from v1.

https://theherobrine422.github.io/spaceSim/v2/

### Features:

1. All features from v1
1. More then just 2 bodies
1. Real Simulated Time Per Second based on how much time has actually passed (useful in the case that you set the framerate to a number that your computer can not handle.)
1. modifiable radius, displayed radius scaler, and starting time attributes for bodies
1. different collision modes.
1. walls on the simulation.
1. Better/worse UI

### Planned Features:

1. bounce collision mode
1. actual UI for creating bodies.
1. zoomable camera to allow real world distances
1. simualtion presets?
